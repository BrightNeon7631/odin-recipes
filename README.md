# Odin Project #1: Recipes

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a simple website with three different recipes found on allrecipes.com. The website looks quite terrible but the goal of the project was to get started with HTML and CSS and practice the fundamentals.

I started and finished this project in December 2021.
